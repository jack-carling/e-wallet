# E-wallet

## Description

School assignment - Vue course

Build a "digital wallet" in Vue which stores all of your credit cards and where you can also add new cards

- [Based on this sketch](https://www.figma.com/file/G4ep4nWFUplM8kXEntq83C/E-Wallet?node-id=11%3A2)
- SPA using Vue Router
- There should be an "active" card and the rest should be stacked
